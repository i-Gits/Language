<!--- while looking for ways to create "a hover to define" effect, i stumbled upon this. It looked so cool so I put this in here just to remind me of the possibilities.--->

  <summary> GOALS </summary>

#  Creating Your First Application
<sub><sub>*copied and pasted from the above linked site</sub></sub>


Your first application, HelloWorldApp, will simply display the greeting "Hello World!" To create this program, you will:

> # 1. Create an IDE project

When you create an IDE project, you ** create an environment ** in which to build and run your applications. Using IDE projects eliminates configuration issues normally associated with developing on the command line. You can build or run your application by choosing a single menu item within the IDE.

IDE <<integrated development environment>>  = a world to build applications. ~ can also run apps there.
pros: less "configuration" issues {usually w command line}

  ### これは何?
  > configuration issues
  > single menu item? 


> # 2. Add code to the generated source file

A source file contains code, written in the Java programming language, that you and other programmers can understand. 
As part of creating an IDE project, a skeleton source file will be automatically generated. You will then modify the source file to add the "Hello World!" message.

  ### これは何?
  > skeleton source file


> # 3. Compile the source file into a .class file

The IDE invokes the Java programming language compiler (javac), 
which takes your source file and translates its text into instructions that the Java virtual machine can understand. 

The instructions contained within this file are known as bytecodes.

  ### これは何？
  > virtual machine
> .class file = compiled source file (so java vm can read it)




> # 4. Run the program

The IDE invokes the Java application launcher tool (java), which uses the Java virtual machine to run your application.

The Java Platform Manager

To set this JDK as the default for all projects, you can run the IDE with the --jdkhome switch on the command line, or by entering the path to the JDK in the netbeans_j2sdkhome property of your INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/etc/netbeans.conf file.
